This repository is for Lab 11 of ECE 6785 - Adv. Embedded Systems.
Owners are Tharnath Bagirathan and Sameeran Chandorkar.

In this lab we were able to create a bluetooth client on the Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller.
This was followed by below activities:
1. Being able to read the heartbeat service
2. Creating a new serive for reading temperature values
3. Modifying the service to publish temperature data in degree celcius
4. We were also able to read the data from an android device using an app
